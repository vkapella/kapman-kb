# DEALER PIPELINE

## Purpose

This file documents the dealer-metrics pipeline mechanics extracted from `llm_runtime/DEALER_v4.0.md` legacy anchors. The runtime DEALER file owns the behavioral contract for interpreting delivered dealer outputs; this file owns the formulas, thresholds, filters, defaults, and data-depth mechanics that produce those outputs.

## Contents

### Contract filtering

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| DTE filter | `dte <= 90` |
| Open-interest filter | `open_interest >= 100` |
| Volume filter | `volume >= 1` |
| Gamma requirement | gamma present |

### GEX computation

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| Per-contract GEX | `gex = gamma * open_interest * spot^2 * 0.01 * contract_multiplier`, with call-side sign inversion |
| Strike-level GEX aggregation | Additive across contracts at the same strike |
| Gamma flip computation | Zero-cross interpolation |
| Gamma flip exact interpolation formula | [CONTENT GAP — operator input required] Source anchor names zero-cross interpolation but does not provide the exact interpolation formula. |

### Wall computation

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| Wall candidate filters | Contract-type match, positive OI, non-null gamma, `abs(strike-spot)/spot <= 0.2` |
| Wall ranking weights | `1.0 / 0.7 / 0.4 / 0.2` across four moneyness bands |
| Moneyness band cutoffs for weights | [CONTENT GAP — operator input required] Source anchor gives the four weight values but not the band boundaries. |
| Ranking sort | Descending weighted GEX, strike tie-break |
| Top-N truncation | Default `top_n = 3` |

### Slope and DGPI

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| GEX slope | `slope = (upper_gex - lower_gex) / price_range` over `±2%` of spot |
| Slope range default | `gex_slope_range_pct = 0.02` |
| DGPI components | Signed log-scaled net GEX, slope multiplier with `±0.3` clamp, optional IV-rank weighting, output clamp to `[-100, 100]` |
| DGPI exact formula | [CONTENT GAP — operator input required] Source anchor names the components but does not provide the complete algebraic formula. |

### Position class

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| Neutral threshold | `|net_gex| < 1,000,000` → `neutral` |
| Positive net GEX class | `long_gamma` |
| Negative net GEX class | `short_gamma` |

### Confidence and dealer-status resolution

| Item | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| Contracts-with-gamma cutoffs | `5/10` cutoffs |
| High-confidence OI floor | Total OI `≥ 1000` for `high` |
| Other confidence labels | `medium` / `low` / `invalid` below source bounds |
| Primary FULL cutoff | FULL requires `eligible_options >= 25` |
| Primary LIMITED cutoff | LIMITED requires `eligible_options >= 1` |
| Dealer-status inputs | Eligible-options count, GEX validity, position-class validity, confidence level |
| Secondary metadata FULL/LIMITED threshold | `min_eligible_threshold = 5`, distinct from the primary classifier's `25` |

### Runtime defaults

| Parameter | Extracted value |
|---|---|
| `walls_top_n` | `3` |
| `gex_slope_range_pct` | `0.02` |
| `max_moneyness` | `0.2` |
| Freshness window | [CONTENT GAP — operator input required] Source workflow says timestamps are compared to the pipeline's freshness window, but no value is provided. |
